ALGORITHM EXPLORATION AND GUI "GHOST" NODES
============================================

This document explains why the Vacuum World GUI sometimes needs to generate "fake" or "ghost" nodes
to complete the search tree visualization, and why different algorithms stop exploring branches.

1. THE GENERAL REASON: "EAGER" GOAL DETECTION
--------------------------------------------
Most search algorithms are designed to be efficient. As soon as they "see" the goal state, they 
stop and return the path. 

In many implementations (including ours), the algorithm checks for the goal when it is generating 
SUCCESSORS of a node. If it finds the goal, it doesn't bother generating the rest of the siblings 
or expanding that node's cousins. This results in a "ragged" tree where the final decision layers 
are missing their alternative branches.

2. ALGORITHM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS
-------------------------------

A* SEARCH & GREEDY SEARCH:
- Why nodes are missing: These are "best-first" searches. They use a Priority Queue. 
- The moment the algorithm "pops" the goal node from the queue, it terminates immediately. 
- It likely leaves many other nodes in the queue "unexpanded." 
- In the GUI, this looks like the last few steps only have one branch (the winner), while the 
  other directions were technically possible but never checked because the robot already found 
  the prize.

BFS (BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH):
- Why nodes are missing: BFS finds the shallowest goal. 
- It explores level-by-level. Once it finds the goal at level N, it stops. 
- It might not have finished checking all other nodes at level N, so those branches appear 
  truncated in the raw algorithm output.

DFS (DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH):
- Why nodes are missing: DFS is the "luckiest" or "unluckiest" algorithm. 
- It follows one path to the bottom. If it hit the goal, it ignores the entire rest of the 
  search space. 
- This creates a tree that is almost entirely "ghost" branches except for the one deep 
  spine it explored.

UCS (UNIFORM COST SEARCH):
- Why nodes are missing: Similar to A*, but based purely on cost. 
- It stops the moment the cheapest path to a goal is confirmed.

NEAREST NEIGHBOR (GREEDY NN):
- Why nodes are missing: Not a search algorithm at all! 
- It is a "procedural" or "constructive" heuristic. It just calculates: "Where is the dirt? Go there."
- It never looks at alternative directions (Up/Down/Left/Right) unless they are part of its 
  direct path to the chosen dirt.

3. THE ROLE OF THE GUI "GHOST" NODES
-----------------------------------
The GUI infills these missing branches (drawn in dimmer colors) for two reasons:

A. Visual Consistency: The user expects a "Vacuum World" to always have the possibility of moving 
   in 4 directions (or Sucking). If the tree only showed one branch, it wouldn't look like a 
   "decision tree."
B. Comparison: By seeing the ghost branches (and their associated costs/heuristics), the user 
   can see *what else* the robot could have done and *why* those choices were worse (e.g., they 
   had a higher H-value or G-cost).

4. THE "NODE LIMIT" FACTOR
-------------------------
To prevent the application from freezing on large maps, we set a TREE_EDGE_LIMIT (e.g., 20,000 edges).
If an algorithm is very "chatty" and explores a massive number of states, it might hit this 
limit before finishing the search tree data. 

In these cases, the GUI uses the guaranteed solution path to "backfill" the tree so you 
always have a complete visualization of the journey, even if the algorithm's internal 
recording was cut short for performance.
